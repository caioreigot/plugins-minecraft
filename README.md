I use <a href="https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit">CraftBukkit</a> to open my own server.
When downloading and executing the ```.jar``` file from CraftBukkit using java (```java -jar <file>.jar```), a folder called "plugins" is generated in the same location, that's where you must place the ```.jar``` file exported from this or another project.
